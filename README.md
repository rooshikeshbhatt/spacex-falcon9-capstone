# SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis – Data Science Capstone

This repository contains the work for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project.

## Project Overview
In this project, I take the role of a Data Scientist at a fictional company, Space Y, 
aiming to compete with SpaceX. The objective is to analyze SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data 
and build a machine learning model to predict whether the first stage of the rocket 
will be reused, which directly impacts launch cost.
